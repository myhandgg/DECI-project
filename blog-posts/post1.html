Streaming services, along with streams of music-related content on video sharing platforms, were incorporated into the methodologies of major record charts. The "album-equivalent unit" was also developed as an alternative metric for the consumption of albums, to account for digital music and streaming. The rise in popularity of music streaming services started in 2005 and has continued to grow steadily. Consumer preferences moving away from traditional physical media towards streaming platforms, attributed to their convenience, variety, and affordability.[1]</p>
